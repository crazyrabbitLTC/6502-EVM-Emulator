# 6502â€‘onâ€‘EVM Emulator

This repository contains a pureâ€‘Solidity implementation of the MOS 6502 CPU together with a **minimal C64â€‘style I/O environment** (keyboard and character terminal).  The goal is to execute unmodified 6502 machineâ€‘code â€” such as EhBASIC 2.22 â€” inside the EVM for educational experiments and onâ€‘chain retroâ€‘computing.

## Key contracts / files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/Emulator6502.sol` | Full CPU model, 64 KiB RAM, runâ€‘loop, opcode dispatcher, softâ€‘vectors, and I/O emulation.  Emits `CharOut`, `TracePC`, `TraceJSR`, and `ProgramHalted` for observability. |
| `src/BasicRom.sol` | A contract whose **runtime byteâ€‘code _is_ the EhBASIC ROM**.  It is loaded into RAM via `loadRomFrom(address, baseAddr)`. |
| `test/` | Extensive Foundry tests â€” unit tests for opcodes & addressing modes plus higherâ€‘level integration tests (BASIC boot, Miniâ€‘ROM demos). |

## Running the emulator

```bash
# build & test everything
forge test -vvv

# run only the minimal ROM demo (fast)
forge test --match-contract MiniRomHelloTest -vv
```

### Miniâ€‘ROM "HELLO WORLD!" demo

`test/MiniRomHello.t.sol` injects 27 bytes of machineâ€‘code at $9000:

```
$9000  A2 00        LDX #$00
$9002  BD 0D 90     LDA $900D,X
$9005  F0 13        BEQ $901A
$9007  8D 01 F0     STA $F001      ; write char â†’ event
$900A  E8           INX
$900B  D0 F5        BNE $9002
$900D  "HELLO WORLD!" 00
$901A  00           BRK            ; vector via IRQ
```

The test captures `CharOut` events and asserts the exact string appears.  This proves the CPU core, memory system, and terminal I/O all function even without BASIC.

### BASIC integration (workâ€‘inâ€‘progress)

The longâ€‘term objective is to run the full EhBASIC interpreter.  Current status:

* ROM loads and reaches the softâ€‘vector table.
* `CHRIN` stub & missing opcodes still under development.

Follow `test/HelloWorld.t.sol` for the debugging harness that traces PCs and JSRs.

## Development workflow

1. Write or modify tests in `test/`.â€ƒUnit tests should prefer synthetic ROM snippets; integration tests may load `BasicRom`.
2. Implement opcodes in `Emulator6502.sol` â€“ add helper methods next to their caller for locality.
3. `forge test -vvv` often; each commit/branch adds passing tests only.
4. Use `emit TracePC` & `pcTraceBuf` for deep ROM debugging.

The section below is the standard Foundry boilerâ€‘plate for convenience.

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

> **ELI5 â€“ Why should I care?**  
> Imagine the tiny **MOS 6502** microprocessor as the brain inside 1980â€‘era home computers like the Commodore 64 or Apple II. With just **3 square millimetres of silicon and 3,510 transistors** it managed to run games, BASIC interpreters, and even early spreadsheets. Fortyâ€‘plus years later we can fit an entire global financial network on one of today's chips â€“ but instead we decided to stick that little 6502 *inside* Ethereum, purely in software! ðŸ¤¯  
>  
> This project shows how you can **emulate** an 8â€‘bit computer in Solidity so it runs deterministically in the EVM, producing events instead of pixels. It's half retroâ€‘computing nostalgia, half smartâ€‘contract engineering exercise. You can load unmodified 6502 machineâ€‘code (like the EhBASIC interpreter) and watch it boot, read "keyboard" bytes, and print characters â€” all on chain.

## Building & loading ROMs

### 1  Author or obtain 6502 machineâ€‘code

You can write 6502 assembly using any crossâ€‘assembler (`[ca65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65)`, [`vasm`](http://www.compilers.de/vasm.html), etc.) or carve out raw bytes in a hexâ€‘editor.

```asm
        ; hello.asm â€“ assemble with ca65 & ld65
        * = $A000         ; origin inside RAM
        LDX #0            ; X = 0
LOOP    LDA MSG,X         ; load byte
        BEQ DONE         ; 0â€‘terminator ?
        STA $F001         ; output char
        INX
        BNE LOOP
DONE    BRK
MSG     .byte "HELLO",0
```

### 2  Package as a Solidity ROM contract *(optional)*

For larger programs you can embed the raw bytes in a contract so tests (or frontâ€‘ends) can deploy and `loadRomFrom()` it at runtime.  See `scripts/build_basic_rom.py` which generates `src/BasicRom.sol` from a 16 KiB binary.

### 3  Load the ROM into the emulator

```solidity
Emulator6502 emu = new Emulator6502();

// (A) Using an onâ€‘chain ROM contract
BasicRom rom = new BasicRom();
emu.loadRomFrom(address(rom), 0xA000); // copy into RAM at $A000

// (B) Manual poke for small snippets
bytes memory code = hex"a9008d01f000"; // LDA #$00 ; STA $F001 ; BRK
for (uint16 i = 0; i < code.length; i++) {
    emu.poke8(0x8000 + i, uint8(code[i]));
}

// Set RESET vector so CPU starts executing at our code
emu.poke8(0xFFFC, 0x00);
emu.poke8(0xFFFD, 0x80); // -> $8000

emu.boot();
emu.run(10);
```

### 4  Observe output

Catch `CharOut(uint8)` logs in tests or frontâ€‘ends to reconstruct the terminal stream.  Use `TracePC`/`TraceJSR` for debugging and `ProgramHalted` for graceful termination.

## Where can you deploy it?

Running 64 KiB of RAM inside the EVM is storageâ€‘heavy; some chains make that affordable, others not so much.  Here's a quick compatibility/economics matrix:

| Network / stack | 0.8.20 compiler | 24 kB codeâ€‘size cap | Gas price / storage cost | Verdict for this 6502 core |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **MegaETH** | âœ” | 24 kB (same as L1) | Ultraâ€‘cheap, tuned for heavy onâ€‘chain compute | **YES â€“ ideal target** |
| **Monad** (testâ€‘net upcoming) | âœ” (Solidity/EVM parity announced) | 24 kB | Very high throughput, low gas | Should work once live; good fit |
| **Arbitrum Orbit** (custom Nitro chains) | âœ” | 24 kB per contract | Chain operator can set nearâ€‘zero gas & high block gas | **YES â€“ deploy on your own Orbit** |
| Arbitrum One / Nova | âœ” | 24 kB | Cheaper than L1 but `SSTORE` still pricey | Works technically, but each `step()` costs 0.3â€“0.6 M gas |
| Ethereum mainnet / Sepolia / Holesky | âœ” | 24 kB | Very high gas for 64 kB storage writes | Deploys, but running even a few hundred instructions exceeds block gas â€“ impractical |
| OPâ€‘Stack chains (Base, Mode, etc.) | âœ” | 24 kB | Similar to Arbitrum One | Technically OK, pricey in practice |
| zkâ€‘rollups (Scroll, Linea, zkSync Era) | âœ” | 24 kB | Proof cost amplifies storage writes | Works, but economics worse than optimistic L2s |
